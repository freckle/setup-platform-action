# Setup Platform Action

GitHub Action to install and configure our [PlatformCLI][platform] and
[Stackctl][] tools.

[platform]: https://github.com/freckle/platform
[stackctl]: https://github.com/freckle/stackctl

**NOTE**: This action is public so that we can use it outside of its own
repository, but the tooling it installs and uses is private. It is of no use
outside Freckle.

## Basic Usage

```yaml
- id: setup
  uses: freckle/setup-platform-action@v7
  with:
    # Required
    token: ${{ secrets.X }}

    # Optional
    # version: 3.2.2.2
    # app-directory: my-app     # If in multi-app repository
    # environment: prod
    # resource: my-resource     # If in multi-resource app
    # stackctl-version: 1.6.0.0
```

The action installs a `platform` executable, configures `PLATFORM_*` environment
variables (so you can just invoke it without global options throughout the
remainder of your workflow), and sets the `tag` output.

This can be used to build and push images,

```yaml
- run: platform container:login
- run: platform container:push --tag '${{ steps.setup.outputs.tag }}'
```

Build and push assets,

```yaml
- run: platform assets:push --tag '${{ steps.setup.outputs.tag }}'
```

Or deploy

```yaml
- run: platform deploy --tag '${{ steps.setup.outputs.tag }}'
```

We also export various `SLACK_*` environment variables, so you don't have to set
as much when notifying via the `rtCamp` action:

```yaml
- if: ${{ always() }}
  uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
  env:
    # Only this is now required
    SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

    # But you probably want this too
    SLACK_COLOR: ${{ job.status }}
    SLACK_MESSAGE: ${{ job.status }}
```

## Stackctl

The action also installs a `stackctl` executable and configures `STACKCTL_*`
variables to work with the specifications generated by PlatformCLI. This means
you can do things like post changeset details to your PR:

```yaml
- run: |
    # Generates content in .platform/specs
    platform deploy --tag '${{ steps.prep.outputs.tag }}' --inspect

    # Which you can work with naturally using Stackctl
    stackctl changes --format pr /tmp/changes.md

- uses: { your preferred add-pr-comment action }
  with:
    body-path: /tmp/changes.md
```
